# The Odin Project: [Project] Landing Page

## Purpose of Project:
The purpose of this project is to have practice using HTML and CSS. Specifically using flex boxes and how to use different properties such as: ```flex-basis, flex-grow, flex-shrink```. While I still have trouble using these CSS properties, this project is meant to highly how I have interupted these CSS properties and how I think I should be using them. 

:stop_sign: For full disgression, I did use follow an image template layout that is offered by The Odin Project official site. This project does not show my full capabilities of creativity but rather shows my markup skills.
